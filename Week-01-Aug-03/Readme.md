## 1. What is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a process used by software developers and teams to design, develop, test, and deploy software. It ensures a systematic approach to building software applications.

### Common SDLC Phases:

1. Requirement Gathering
2. Planning
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

### Popular SDLC Models:

- Waterfall Model
- Agile Model

## 2. What is Agile?

Agile is a methodology for software development that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery of functional software through small, iterative cycles called sprints.

### Key Characteristics:

- Short development cycles (sprints)
- Frequent delivery of working software
- Continuous feedback from stakeholders
- Collaboration between cross-functional teams
- Tools: Jira, Scrum boards, user stories, epics

## 3. Agile vs DevOps

| Feature                 | Agile                                 | DevOps                                      |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Focus                   | Development Process                   | Development and Operations                  |
| Goal                    | Deliver software quickly              | Deliver software reliably and frequently    |
| Team Structure          | Dev and QA                            | Dev, QA, and Ops (collaborative teams)      |
| Feedback Cycle          | Sprint-based                          | Continuous                                  |
| Tools                   | Jira, Confluence                      | Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.      |
| Automation Level        | Moderate (mostly testing)             | High (CI/CD, infra as code, monitoring)     |
| Final Outcome           | Working software                      | Working software that is stable in production |

## 4. What is DevOps?

DevOps is a combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that integrates and automates the work of software development and IT operations teams. It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery of high-quality software.

### Key DevOps Principles:

1. Collaboration: Development and operations work together throughout the product lifecycle.
2. Automation: Automate testing, building, deployment, and infrastructure.
3. Continuous Improvement: Frequent iterations and feedback to improve speed and quality.
4. Customer-Centric: Focused on user feedback and value.
5. Create with the End in Mind: Develop with deployment and operations in consideration from the start.

## 5. Git and GitHub (Hands-on Practice)

### What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.

### What is GitHub?

GitHub is a platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories in the cloud.

### Common Git Commands:

```bash
git init
git clone <repository-url>
git branch
git status
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push origin main
```


## Practice Task:

Create a GitHub account.

Create a new repository.

Clone it to your local machine.

Create a file (e.g., index.html).

Push the file to GitHub.
