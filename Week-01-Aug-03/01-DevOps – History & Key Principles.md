# DevOps – History & Key Principles

## History of DevOps

DevOps began in the late 2000s (around 2007) when development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams were working in silos, causing:

- Slow releases  
- Poor collaboration  
- Unreliable software in production  

While Agile helped developers deliver code faster, operations teams still followed slow, manual processes.

To solve this gap, DevOps emerged as a cultural and technical movement that:

- Brings Dev and Ops together to work as one team  
- Uses automation and continuous delivery  
- Aims to deliver software faster, reliably, and more efficiently  

### Key Concepts that Influenced DevOps

- **Agile Methodology**: Short development cycles (sprints), planning via stories/backlogs, and quick delivery.  
- **CI/CD**: Automating build, test, and deployment so that changes can be delivered multiple times per day.  
- **Git & Version Control**: Enables collaboration, rollback, and traceability of code.  
- **ITSM (IT Service Management)**: Delivers and supports IT as a service—end-to-end.  
- **Incident Management**: Teams detect and recover from production issues faster by working together.  

## 5 Key Principles of DevOps

DevOps isn’t just about tools—it’s a mindset and culture shift. Here are its five core principles:

### 1. Collaboration

- Dev and Ops work together across the entire lifecycle.  
- Teams are often merged into a single unit.  
- Encourages ownership, faster communication, and better quality output.  

### 2. Automation

- Automate testing, integration, deployment, monitoring, etc.  
- Reduces human error and saves time.  
- Foundation for CI/CD pipelines.  

### 3. Continuous Improvement

- Focus on experimenting, optimizing, and eliminating waste.  
- Regularly release updates and fix issues quickly.  
- Drive faster innovation and better performance.  

### 4. Customer-Centric Action

- Products are built based on real-time feedback and user behavior.  
- Uses monitoring tools and analytics to iterate fast.  

### 5. Create with the End in Mind

- Teams build solutions with a clear understanding of the customer’s needs.  
- No building in isolation—focus on practical outcomes.  

## Summary

DevOps = Culture + Practices + Tools  
It helps teams build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.
